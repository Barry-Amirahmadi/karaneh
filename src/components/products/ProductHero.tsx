/**
 * Project opener.
 *
 * The one page on the site where the ambient light has nothing to decide: a
 * single project is on screen, so the field simply holds that project's tone
 * for the whole section. §50's hover-or-scroll rule exists to arbitrate between
 * several projects competing for the field — with one, there is no competition,
 * and the wash becomes what it always wanted to be here, the page's own colour.
 *
 * The photograph sits at the start edge, where a Persian reader begins, and the
 * copy across the gutter — the `tall` arrangement from the showcase, at hero
 * scale. On a phone that stacks to image-then-copy, which is the right order
 * for a page whose subject is the space itself.
 *
 * The additional views hang directly off the primary image rather than getting
 * a band of their own, because they are the same photograph's siblings.
